# PlagiarismDetector-Algorithm
1. Description:

The objective of this project is to set up a prototype for the detection of plagiarism. This prototype must be based on longer common subsequence (LCS) problem.
In addition, to display the sequence found, we implemented the printing neatly algorithm.

After the implementation of the different algorithm, an experimental study on the behavior of the different algorithms is also present.

2. Algorithms:

In this project, the different algorithms used for the Longuest commun Subsequence LCS problem: Dynamic Programing algorithm, Branch and Bound, Divide and Conquer.

We used also different versions of the Printing Neatly algorithm: Greedy Version, Dynamic Programming version, Recursive approach with a branch and bound extension.
